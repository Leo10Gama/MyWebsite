            <h1>Leonardo Gama</h1>
            <div>
                <p>Hello and welcome to my website! I'm a 2nd year Computer Science student at York University, here to continue learning, growing, and bettering myself.</p>
                <p>I'm very passionate about many things, such as programming, music, and playing games. In the near future, I hope to combine this grab-bag mix of talents into something meaningful!</p>
                <p>If you're here with the interest of hiring me and reviewing my background, here are some relevant links:</p>

                        <h3>L30-Series Discord Bots</h3>
                        <p>
                            These Discord bots each do somewhat similar tasks, with some differences. The first model, <a href="https://github.com/Leo10Gama/L30Gamma" target="blank">L30-Gamma</a>, uses JavaScript, while the
                            second model, <a href="https://github.com/Leo10Gama/L30Pi" target="blank">L30-Pi</a>, uses Python. Each makes use of similar API provided by Discord to interact with the server interface, as well
                            as other API such as PokeAPI or BeautifulSoup to perform supplementary tasks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each bot does its own thing, but their primary purpose is to show pictures of cats. Images are shown either at random, or a random image of a specific cat can be seen if that cat's name
                            is entered following the command. In addition, the L30-Pi model is capable of interacting with websites like <a href="https://en.numista.com/" target="blank">Numista</a>, 
                            <a href="https://www.ninsheetmusic.org/" target="blank">NinSheetMusic</a>, and <a href="https://downloads.khinsider.com/" target="blank">KHInsider</a> to get more information oncoins, 
                            sheet music, or video game soundtracks respectively.

                <h2>Pyrography Commissions</h2>
                <p><i>Currently <b>OPEN</b></i></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>You may also be on my site because you are interested in commissioning me to burn something for you! If that's the case, here are some of my general guidelines and approximate rates:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>
                        I charge a flat rate of $15 to cover the cost of materials. This may scale depending on the requested size of the commission.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        On top of the flat rate, I charge an additional $5 per hour spent burning. This simply means more intricate and detailed designs will cost more than simpler ones.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        I will request a downpayment (typically $10 unless the cost is notably high) before I begin your commission to ensure I still get paid if you decide not to purchase the piece upon completion.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        Additional features such as frames, additional designs on the sides, and different shapes (e.g. hearts or circles instead of rectangles or squares) may be subject to additional fees. This includes
                        the request of a design being burnt into a tree slice, given that the requested slice is notably large.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        When completed, I will send you an image of the finished project and request the remaining payment. Once it is paid, I will send the commission by mail to you. If your location happens to be
                        nearby enough to me, I may also hand-deliver you the commission to reduce delivery time, though this would be at your own discretion.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        Unless requested otherwise, all projects are burned on poplar wood and sealed with varnish. Other woods or finishes (e.g. an design on oak wood sealed with epoxy) may also be subject to additional fees.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        I will not burn designs that are NSFW, nor will I burn anything controversial, political, or discriminatory.
                    </p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>To request a commission, please send me an email at <b>**EMAIL ADDRESS**</b> with a description of what you would like, alongside an image of the design (if applicable). 
                    From there, we can negotiate deadlines and I can provide you with a quote. Please be aware that I am only one person, so designs may take between 1-2 weeks latest to be
                    completed, burned, and sealed.
