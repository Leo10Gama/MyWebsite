                <section class="section">
                    <p>If you're interested in commissioning me to burn you something in wood (like <a href="gallery.html">one of these</a>), then here are some of my general guidelines and rates:</p>
                    <ul class="scrollable-section">
                        <li><p>
                            I charge an initial $15 to cover the cost of materials. This may scale depending on the requested size of the commission.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                            On top of the flat rate, I charge an additional $15 per hour spent burning. This simply means more intricate and detailed designs will cost more than simpler ones.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                            I will request a downpayment (typically 25% of the cost) before I begin your commission.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                            Additional features such as frames, additional designs on the sides, and different shapes (e.g. hearts or circles instead of rectangles or squares) may be subject to additional fees.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                            When completed, I will send you an image of the finished project and request the remaining payment. Once it is paid, I will send the commission by mail to you. If your location happens to be
                            nearby enough to me, I may also offer pickup/delivery to reduce delivery time, though this would be at your own discretion.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                            Unless requested otherwise, all commissions will be burned on my choice of wood (typically either poplar or some other soft, light wood, or whichever will look best for your request!) and 
                            sealed with varnish. Other types of wood and seals are available upon request, but may be subject to additional fees.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                            I will not burn designs that are NSFW, nor will I burn anything controversial, political, or discriminatory in nature.
                        </p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        To request a commission, please send me an email at <b>leo10gama@gmail.com</b> with a description of what you would like, alongside an image of the design (if applicable). 
                        From there, we can negotiate deadlines and I can provide you with a quote. Please be aware that I am only one person, so designs may take between 1-2 weeks at the latest to be
                        completed, burned, and sealed.
