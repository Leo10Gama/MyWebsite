                <h2>Pyrography Commissions</h2>
                <p class="subtitle">Currently <b>OPEN</b></p>
                <section class="section">
                    <p>You may also be on my site because you are interested in commissioning me to burn something for you! If that's the case, here are some of my general guidelines and approximate rates:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>
                            I charge an initial $15 to cover the cost of materials. This may scale depending on the requested size of the commission.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                            On top of the flat rate, I charge an additional $7 per half hour spent burning (rounded generously). This simply means more intricate and detailed designs will cost more than simpler ones.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                            I will request a downpayment (typically 25% of the cost) before I begin your commission.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                            Additional features such as frames, additional designs on the sides, and different shapes (e.g. hearts or circles instead of rectangles or squares) may be subject to additional fees. This may include
                            the request of a design being burnt into a tree slice.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                            When completed, I will send you an image of the finished project and request the remaining payment. Once it is paid, I will send the commission by mail to you. If your location happens to be
                            nearby enough to me, I may also hand-deliver you the commission to reduce delivery time, though this would be at your own discretion.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                            Unless requested otherwise, all projects are burned on poplar wood and sealed with varnish. Other woods or finishes (e.g. an design on oak wood sealed with epoxy) may also be subject to additional fees.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                            I will not burn designs that are NSFW, nor will I burn anything controversial, political, or discriminatory in nature.
                        </p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        To request a commission, please send me an email at <b>**EMAIL ADDRESS**</b> with a description of what you would like, alongside an image of the design (if applicable). 
                        From there, we can negotiate deadlines and I can provide you with a quote. Please be aware that I am only one person, so designs may take between 1-2 weeks at the latest to be
                        completed, burned, and sealed.
