                    <p>If you're interested in commissioning me to burn you something in wood (like <a href="gallery.html">one of these</a>), here's some relevant information:</p>
                    <p><b>Fees and Prices:</b></p>
                    <ul class="scrollable-section">
                        <li><p>
                            Since all projects are unique, costs will vary quite significantly. For reference, a 4" wood slice coaster may be between $40-$60, a 12"x26" charcuterie board may be around $75-$125, and 
                            a 6"x6" wood tablet may be between $50-$100. Higher prices will generally be associated with more complex and intricate designs.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                            Additional features on your commission, such as frames or designs along the sides or back are subject to additional fees.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                            For a more accurate idea of what your specific request may cost, I'm more than happy to provide you with a quote. Please contact me at my email address at the bottom of this block.
                        </p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Guidelines:</b></p>
                    <ul class="scrollable-section">
                        <li><p>
                            I will not burn designs that are NSFW, nor will I burn anything controversial, political, or discriminatory in nature.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                            Upon making and agreeing on a commission request, I will ask for a downpayment (typically 25% of the cost) before I begin your commission.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                            When completed, I will send you an image of the finished project and request the remaining payment. Once it is paid, I will send the commission by mail to you. If your location happens to be
                            nearby enough to me, I may also offer pickup/delivery to reduce delivery time, though this would be at your discretion.
                        </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                            Unless requested otherwise, all commissions will be burned on my choice of wood (typically either poplar or some other soft, light wood, or whichever will look best for your request!) and 
                            sealed with varnish. Other types of wood and seals are available upon request, but may be subject to additional fees.
                        </p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        To request a commission, please send me an email at <b>leo10gama@gmail.com</b> with a description of what you would like, alongside an image of the design (if applicable). 
                        From there, we can negotiate deadlines and I can provide you with a quote. Please be aware that I am only one person, so designs may take some time to be completed, burned, and sealed.
